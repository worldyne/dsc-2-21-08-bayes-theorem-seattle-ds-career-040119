    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Before introducing Parametric inference, it is necessary to understand Bayes’ theorem (Bayes' Law) and its different components. What makes Bayes' theorem useful is that it allows incorporation of some knowledge or belief that we already have (commonly known as the prior) to help us calculate the probability of a related event. Looking back at our initial example, we identified the need for having some ability to incorporate our prior beliefs or understanding in order to figure out if our mood has any impact on the weather. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will explain how we can consider doing this. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "* Understand and describe the Bayesian theorem from conditional probabilities\n",
    "* Describe the roles of Prior, Likehood and Posterior components of Bayes Theorem \n",
    "* Understand and perform simple applications of Bayes Theorem for sensitivity and specificity"

    "## Mathematical definition\n",
    "Bayes theorem is a special case of conditional probabilities and mathematically this theorem is defined as below.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will usually see Bayes Theorem displayed in one of two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|not A)P(not A)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here P(A|B) stands for the Probability that A happened given B has occured. These are both the same, in the second case, you would use this form if you don't directly have the Probability of B occuring on its own. (not A is same as A complement)\n"

P(A) and P(B) are the called marginal probabilities of event A and event B occurring respectively.\n",

    "### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In a medical context, we might be interested in finding out a patient’s probability of having liver disease if they are an alcoholic. “Being an alcoholic” is the key test for liver disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A could be the event “Patient has liver disease.” Past data tells us that 10% of patients entering your clinic have liver disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A) = 0.10$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* B could be the event that “Patient is an alcoholic.” Five percent of the clinic’s patients are alcoholics. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(B) = 0.05$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We also know that among those patients diagnosed with liver disease, 7% are alcoholics. This is our P(B|A) i.e. the probability that a patient is alcoholic, **given** that they have liver disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bring in the Bayes’ theorem \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A|B) = (0.07 * 0.1)/0.05 = 0.14$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if the patient is an alcoholic, their chances of having liver disease is 0.14 (14%). This is a large increase from the 10% suggested by past data. But it is still unlikely that any particular patient has liver disease."

    "## The PRIOR Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "This is calculated as $P(A)$ on the right hand side is the expression that is known as the **prior**. $P(A)$ is the marginal probability of patient having liver disease, regardless of their alcohol consumption. i.e. no conditioning taking place here. This is called the \"prior\" as it reflects the prior probability of the disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we effectively have this prior knowledge before deciding anything on the effect of alcohol on liver disease. This is a fundamental step that allows incorporation of what we already know before we solve a new problem.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases we may not have any prior information in terms of frequencies to calculate the marginal prior probability. In such cases we can create a subjective prior where using our experience of selling ice cream (or some domain knowledge to make informed guesses).So it is possible to have a P(A) probability that is not based on any real data. As we shall see later, Bayesian inference allows us to improve our priors if they do not match with incoming data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The LIKELIHOOD\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(B|A)$ in our bayesian equation is the likelihood. it shows the probability of a patient being alcoholic , GIVEN that he has a liver disease. It’s not a probability, but it is **proportional** to a probability. The likelihood of a hypothesis (B) given some data (A) is proportional to the probability of obtaining B given that A is true. \n",
    "However, since a likelihood is not actually a probability, many of the rules that apply to probability don't necessarily apply to a likelihood. An example of that is that likelihood doesn't need to sum up to 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important difference between likelihood and probability is the fact that when looking at a conditional probability, L(D|H), the hypothesis is treated as \"fixed\" and the data can vary. When talking about a likelihood, the situation is exactly opposite, with L(H|D) meaning that the data is fixed and the hypothesis can vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Posterior Probability \n",
    "\n",
    "$P(A|B)$ is known as the posterior probability and is the revised probability of an event occurring after taking into consideration new information. Posterior probability is calculated by updating the prior probability by using Bayes' theorem. In statistical terms, the posterior probability is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior probability represents what is originally believed before new evidence is introduced, and posterior probability takes this new information into account. For our example above, this reflects th probability of having a liver disease, given that the patient is an alcoholic. "
